## 1.Project Summary
●Home Page:Nicole Cahoon http://nicolecahoon.com/contact/
●The design makes it difficult to understand that this is a business consulting company, so we will make it clear that we are a trustworthy business consulting company.
Also, the hero image is too large and takes up the entire screen, so even if you move to another page, the same hero image remains displayed and it is not clear that the screen has changed.
The target users are mainly local small business owners, so the site will be viewed by a limited number of people.

## 2. Look and feel
The overall color tone is dark, so we will change it to a brighter, more sincere color tone.
Change the page color scheme to match the AdobeColor-Business Casual color palette.
